    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I come working with <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> and the better Gem I&rsquo;ve seen is <a href="https://github.com/iconara/rubydoop">Rubydoop</a>, but it has an issue with Hadoop 2.0.x, basically does not support it because has been changed its API.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I created an <a href="https://github.com/iconara/rubydoop/issues/9">issue</a> and few days late received a <a href="https://github.com/iconara/rubydoop/issues/9#issuecomment-18968195">patch</a> to fix it :D, but with a condition: I should build the .jar myself (and gem).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll expect that you have set up hadoop 2.0.x.</p>

<h3>1 &ndash; Clone repository</h3>

<p>Very simple, you need clone the repository and switch to branch that has fix.
<code>
git clone git@github.com:iconara/rubydoop.git &amp;&amp; \
cd rubydoop &amp;&amp; \
git checkout hadoop_204
</code></p>

<p>Branch <a href="https://github.com/iconara/rubydoop/commit/1db2054246fced0cba0f48ef330adf1b0a8c2f85">hadoop_204</a> has commit.</p>

<h3>2 &ndash; Export MY_RUBY_HOME</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/iconara/rubydoop/blob/hadoop_204/Rakefile#L15"><code>Rakefile</code></a> expects that you have an environment variable called <code>MY_RUBY_HOME</code>
<code>
export MY_RUBY_HOME=/path/home/jruby
</code></p>

<p>The above path depends on your SO.</p>

<h3>3 &ndash; Create .classpath</h3>

<p>This file was created me more problems, because there is not nothing clean about what is the right content. In fact, I followed <a href="https://github.com/iconara/rubydoop/issues/9#issuecomment-21289355">suggestion made by @iconara</a>, but did not work for me.</p>

<p>This file must be created in root dir where you cloned repository.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, this post expect that you have set up <strong>hadoop 2.0.x</strong></p>

<p>What path I should put into <code>.classpath</code> file?</p>

<p><code>
hadoop classpath
</code></p>

<p>The previous command to show you the <code>HADOOP_CLASSPATH</code>, basically where Hadoop has their jars files.</p>

<p>I needed to put two jars into <code>.classpath</code> to everything worked as expected.</p>

<p>Here my <code>.classpath</code></p>

<p><code>
/path/hadoop/common/hadoop-common-2.0.4-alpha.jar
/path/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.0.4-alpha.jar
</code></p>

<p>Once you set the right paths the rest it&rsquo;s very simple, you need run the following command.</p>

<p><code>
rake build
</code></p>

<p>Whether everything is fine, the previous command should build <code>lib/rubydoop.jar</code> (reason of this post).</p>

<p><code>
gem build rubydoop.gemspec
</code></p>

<p>The above command will produce an output like:</p>

<p><code>
Successfully built RubyGem
Name: rubydoop
Version: 1.1.0.pre7
File: rubydoop-1.1.0.pre7.gem
</code></p>

<p>Finally, You need install your gem that recently has been built. Just put it in the working directory and run <code>gem install rubydoop</code> Rubygems picks <code>.gem</code> files in the working directory over gems on rubygems.org.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I suggest change the gem version, by this way you can add a specific version in your <code>Gemfile</code> and avoid conflict with current release version. In fact, as you can see I changed Rubydoop version to <code>1.1.0.pre7</code>.</p>
